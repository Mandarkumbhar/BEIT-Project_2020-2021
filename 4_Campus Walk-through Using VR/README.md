Description :

Virtual campus acts as an interactive walk-through application that is based on Virtual
Reality. This paper explains all phases of building the virtual campus starting from requirement gathering to building the final application, which includes other phases such as
modeling, texture mapping, and scripting. This Virtual Reality application can be used by
the institute to introduce students, newcomers, to the campus with a Virtual Model of the
college and make them familiar with the facilities available. It will provide a real-life walkthrough of the campus while being stationary with VR ready devices. It uses Blender for
preparing 3d models, unity 3d to prepare the structural model, and adding user interaction
to an application through scripts and Google VR plugins.
